                Candice Dailey is a freelance illustrator residing in Missouri. Her interest in art was sparked at a
                very early age by a passion for fantasy and science fiction which continues to shape her works. Candice
                has a bachelor’s degree in commercial art with an emphasis in illustration from the University of
                Central Missouri. She continues to study and perfect her trade today, always striving to become
                better.
